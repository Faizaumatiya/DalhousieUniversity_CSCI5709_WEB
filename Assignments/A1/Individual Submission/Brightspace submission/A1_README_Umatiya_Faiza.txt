## TOOLS USED:

Individual Assignment -1 Submission:
Requirement for Individual Assignment was to make 
a) User experience and taskflow - tools used: draw.io [1]
b) Lo-fidelity Prototype - tools used balsamiq [2]
c) Semi-Functional prototype - Visual Studio [3]

## DEPLOYMENT

I first created a simple react app [4] and pushed in on Gitlab. Made some minor changes and pushed the changes in Gitlab again (modified app). After making changes on Gitlab, i created a new repository in GitHub to deploy in Netlify. After pushing the same react app on GitHub, I created account on Netlify [5]. The Netlify account was linked with the GitHub repository. After authorization is done, the application was deployed in a minute. Therefore, the simple react app was deployed on Netlify successfully.

After deploying my code, I checked that the code is W3C Compliant using W3C validator [14].

## SEMI-FUNCTIONAL PROTOTYPE SOURCE CODE USAGE

As required by the individual assignment-1 submission requirement, we could use the boilerplate code for the purpose of fulfillment of assignment.
All the files just consist of code from basic boilerplate code referenced from [4].
For other parts of code i looked online to learn things like creating navbar from bootstrap, dropdown menus, styling, adding image source. So the reference i took are [6], [7], [8], [9], [10], [11], [12], [13].



# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).
